# Literary-Explorer 📖✨
Using NLP to perform literary analysis on novels - starting with Sally Rooney's *Normal People*

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to use machine learning techniques to analyse Sally Rooney's *Normal People* to uncover patterns in dialogue, emotional tone, and character interactions. By presenting this analysis in a way that resonates with Gen Z audiences, the project explores the intersection of literature, technology, and linguistics.

## Key Objectives

- **📊 Text Analysis:** Perform sentiment analysis, dialogue tagging, and emotional tone detection on the text of *Normal People*.
- **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Character Interaction Study:** Analyze character interactions to understand dynamics such as manipulation, support, and conflict.
- **🌍 Cultural Impact:** Relate findings to broader cultural themes and trends, making connections to current pop culture phenomena.
- **🎨 Engaging Presentation:** Present findings in an engaging and accessible manner, including blog posts, video essays, and interactive visualizations.

## Project Phases

### 🛠️ Phase 1: Project Setup

#### 📚 Literature Review
- Study *Normal People* and related academic literature.
- Research existing machine learning techniques for text analysis.
- Review pop culture content creation strategies popular with Gen Z.

#### 📥 Data Collection
- Obtain a digital copy of *Normal People*.
- Extract and clean the text data for analysis.

### 📈 Phase 2: Text Analysis

#### 😀 Sentiment Analysis
- Use natural language processing (NLP) tools to perform sentiment analysis on the text.
- Identify positive, negative, and neutral sentiments in dialogues and narrative descriptions.

#### 💬 Dialogue Tagging
- Tag and categorize different types of dialogues (e.g., supportive, manipulative, neutral).
- Use machine learning models like BERT or GPT-3 for dialogue classification.

#### 😲 Emotional Tone Detection
- Analyse emotional tones using NLP techniques.
- Identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and fear.

### 🔍 Phase 3: Character Interaction Study

#### 🗺️ Interaction Mapping
- Map interactions between characters to visualise relationships and dynamics.
- Use network analysis tools to create interaction graphs.

#### 📊 Behaviour Analysis
- Study characters' behaviors and how they influence each other.
- Identify patterns of manipulation, support, and conflict.

### 🌐 Phase 4: Cultural Impact and Connection

#### 🎭 Thematic Analysis
- Relate findings to broader cultural and societal themes.
- Discuss how the behaviors and interactions in *Normal People* reflect or contrast with current pop culture phenomena.

#### 📺 Pop Culture Connection
- Create analogies and connections to popular movies, TV shows, and social media trends.
- Highlight relevant Gen Z cultural references.
